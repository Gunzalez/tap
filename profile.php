                    <h3 class="name">Dr Catherine Hood</h3>
                    <p>Dr Catherine Hood is a health broadcaster and writer. She presented Channel Five’s prime time series A Girl's Guide to 21st Century Sex and regularly appears on The Wright Stuff discussing all aspects of general medicine.</p>
                    <p>Ten years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem and no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-team.</p>
                    <p>This is my boss, Jonathan Hart, a self-made millionaire, he's quite a guy. This is Mrs H., she's gorgeous, she's one lady who knows how to take care of herself. By the way, my name is Max. I take care of both of them, which ain't easy, 'cause when they met it was MURDER!</p>
